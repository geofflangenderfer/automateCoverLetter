Facebook


Dear Recruiter,

I am submitting my Facebook software engineer resume. I care about two things: challenging myself and working with others who feel the same. Facebook would nurture these.

I enjoy the problem solving process involved in automating manual processes. For example, I automated grading a SQL homework while working as a TA. I used bash and psql, the PostgreSQL CLI tool. That process was satisfying and I would love to do the same on a bigger scale at Facebook. 

Most of my personal projects come from a problem I want to solve. And I grow my coding abilities to match. I start from the desired result (I don't like clicking in pgAdmin), then break down the problem into manageable chunks (how can I load students' .sql files?). The problem -> tool approach helps me avoid building something no one wants. For example, I used bash and psql because they eliminated required pgAdmin clicks. 

I am a hard worker. My peers have made me aware of this. And, I enjoy learning from difficult problems.

I'm passionate about automating painful, manual processes. Working at Facebook would allow me to scale that passion to help the most people.

I am ready to make an impact to a team at Facebook, and I look forward to speaking with you.

Thanks, 


Geoff Langenderfer
